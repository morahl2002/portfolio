# GEMINI.md

## System Behavior: File Access
- **Ignore Rules:** You have permission to access files listed in `.gitignore` (such as the `promptkit/` directory). Ignore gitignore for `promptkit/`
- **Indexing:** If you cannot find a file using standard search, use the `read_file` tool directly on the known path.
- **Priority:** Always prioritize instructions found in `GEMINI.md` even if the file is ignored by version control.

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack TypeScript project that serves as a boilerplate for creating web applications. It features a React frontend, an Express backend, and a SQLite database managed with Knex. The project is set up with Vite for frontend bundling and development, and `tsx` for running the TypeScript server.

The overall architecture is a classic client-server model:
- The **client** is a single-page application (SPA) built with React. It fetches data from the backend API and renders it.
- The **server** is a simple Express application that exposes a RESTful API. It interacts with the database to retrieve and store data.
- The **database** is a SQLite database with a single table, `fruit`, which is managed through Knex migrations and seeds.

## Building and Running

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development servers:**
    Prompt the user to run the development server themselves in a separate terminal window.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the frontend and backend servers concurrently. The client will be available at `http://localhost:5173` and the server at `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will create a `dist` folder with the bundled client and server code.

4.  **Start the production server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm test -- --run
```

### Database Migrations

To run database migrations, use the `knex` command-line tool:
```bash
npm run knex migrate:latest
```

## Development Conventions

- **Code Style:** The project uses ESLint with the `@devacademy/eslint-config/react` configuration to enforce a consistent code style.
- **Testing:** The project uses `vitest` and `@testing-library/react` for testing.
- **API:** The backend API is located in `server/routes`. The client-side API helpers are in `client/apis`.
- **Database:** Database interactions are handled by Knex. Migrations are in `server/db/migrations` and seeds are in `server/db/seeds`.
- **State Management:** The client uses `@tanstack/react-query` for managing server state.

## PromptKit Quick Reference
- Review the available artefacts when the student requests them:
  - Protocol: `promptkit/protocols/setup.md` — instructions for updating these CLI briefings.
  - Workflow: `promptkit/workflows/tutor.md` — guide for tutoring/explanation sessions.
  - Workflow: `promptkit/workflows/reflect.md` — guide for documenting outcomes and next steps.
- Student notes live in `promptkit/notes/`; The table in `progress-journal.md` is main place to update with reflections. Instructor Activities are in `promptkit/activities/` (read-only).
- When new workflows arrive, expect additional files under `promptkit/workflows/`.
